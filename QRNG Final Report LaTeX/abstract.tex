This study aims to explore the concepts and proposed schemes to achieve True Random Number Generators (TRNGs), focusing on Entropy Sources where the characteristics of Quantum Systems provide excellent irreproducible randomness, yet with some defects that can be overcome using: The Post Processors. 
In this work, we introduce, explore, and benchmark a novel PostProcessing approach called CQTPP and some of its variants CQTPP+MarkovChain, highlighting its good performance in decorrelating and debiasing a biased and dependent input, at the cost of extraction efficiency, which we attempted to improve slightly through a proposed scheme called Itterative CQTPP. We also introduce the cqt\_rng package and how we tried to improve it and introduce some  novel parts, this library implements Quantum Random Number Generation based on Boson Sampling also revisited in this study.
