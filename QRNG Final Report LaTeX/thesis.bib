abstract="The true ingredient of any lottery system to be successful is randomness of its underlying algorithm. Since the introduction of gambling and lottery industry into cryptocurrency market, trust and security have been less of a concern for organizations, unlike randomness and verifiability. Many of the existing lottery designs use dynamic attributes of either game or blockchain to introduce randomness in its algorithm and only a handful of them are verifiable. In this paper, we introduce a lottery system design having novel random function, which uses combination of game and blockchain state to produce randomness in underlying algorithm and is verifiable. Proposed lottery DApp, built on Ethereum platform, includes smart contracts that help system to achieve properties like decentralization, transparency, and immutability. These properties combined with randomness and verifiability lead to this significant lottery design to be unique of its kind.",

@ARTICLE{June_2009,title={Random . org : Introduction to Randomness and Random Numbers},year={2009},author={Mads Haahr June},doi={null},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={null},journal={null},abstract={Randomness and random numbers have traditionally been used for a variety of purposes, for example games such as dice games. With the advent of computers, people recognized the need for a means of introducing randomness into a computer program. Surprising as it may seem, however, it is difficult to get a computer to do something by chance. A computer running a program follows its instructions blindly and is therefore completely predictable. Computer engineers chose to introduce randomness into computers in the form of pseudorandom number generators. As the name suggests, pseudo-random numbers are not truly random. Rather, they are computed from a mathematical formula or simply taken from a precalculated list. A lot of research has gone into pseudo-random number theory and modern algorithms for generating them are so good that the numbers look exactly like they were really random. Pseudorandom numbers have the characteristic that they are predictable, meaning they can be predicted if you know where in the sequence the first number is taken from. For some purposes, predictability is a good characteristic, for others it is not. Random numbers are used for computer games but they are also used on a more serious scale for the generation of cryptographic keys and for some classes of scientific experiments. For scientific experiments, it is convenient that a series of random numbers can be replayed for use in several experiments, and pseudo-random numbers are well suited for this purpose. For cryptographic use, however, it is important that the numbers used to generate keys are not just seemingly random; they must be truly unpredictable.}}

abstract="The one-time pad is a simple cipher. It ensures a perfect form of confidentiality known as perfect secrecy by combining a plaintext and a key of the same length with the exclusive-or (XOR) operator to produce a ciphertext. It is interesting from a theoretical point of view, but it could be more complex and questionable to use in practice. One-time pad is very appealing because of its perfect secrecy property. However, it lacks basic security properties shared by standard ciphers, namely authentication and integrity. In practice, its usage is rare and limited to circumstances where perfect secrecy is of utmost importance and integrity and authenticity can be guaranteed by other means.",

 abstract = {We consider procedures for converting input sequences of symbols generated by a stationary random process into sequences of independent, equiprobable output symbols, measuring the efficiency of such a procedure when the input sequence is finite by the expected value of the ratio of output symbols to input symbols. For a large class of processes and a large class of procedures we give an obvious information-theoretic upper bound to efficiency. We also construct procedures which attain this bound in the limit of long input sequences without making use of the process parameters, for two classes of processes. In the independent case we generalize a 1951 result of von Neumann and 1970 results of Hoeffding and Simons for independent but biased binary input, gaining a factor of 3 or 4 in efficiency. In the finite-state case we generalize a 1968 result of Samuelson for two-state binary Markov input, gaining a larger factor in efficiency.},
