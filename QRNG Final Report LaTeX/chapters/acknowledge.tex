I am grateful to Dr. Taha, the principal investigator of the Constantine Quantum Technology Group, for giving me the chance to work with his brilliant team in a field I truly adore and will certainly try to make others appreciate as well.

I thank my supervisor, Mohammed Messaoud Louamri, for his great support, kindness, and extensive knowledge.

I also express my gratitude to Bohr, Schr√∂dinger, and Einstein for giving humanity this quantum science, which will undoubtedly conquer and become a major part of mankind's future.
